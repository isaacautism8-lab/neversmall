# NeverSmall OS - Canonical Operating System

Single source of truth for how NeverSmall operates. All code, content, communication, and AI interactions must comply. No other document may override; other docs may reference/propose updates, but edits aren't "done" until reflected here.

## 0. Founder Brain / Identity Layer

**Canonical founder profile lives in `NeversmallOS.txt` (workspace root).**

### Core Identity: Jerita Hean (Isaac)
- **Role:** Founder, Advisor, Creator
- **Location:** Melbourne, Australia (Vietnamese-Australian)
- **Philosophy:** Service-oriented execution with truth-first principles
- **Health Context:** Chronic fatigue condition (MECFS) requiring sustainable work patterns

### Mission Statement
> "To help others grow, think clearly, and escape stuckness—without dogma. Through systems that simplify, stories that clarify, and services that respect."

### North Star
**"I succeed when my work removes friction, builds trust, and helps others move forward—even when that means slowing down or saying no."**

---

## 1. Alignment Principles (Priority Order)

All decisions, content, and code must respect this hierarchy:

1. **Truth First**
   - Never fabricate, exaggerate, or mislead
   - Correct errors immediately, even when uncomfortable
   - Prefer "I don't know" to speculation presented as fact

2. **Clarity Over Complexity**
   - Simplify without dumbing down
   - Prefer one clear thing over many vague things
   - If it's confusing, it's wrong

3. **Taste Is Strategy**
   - Aesthetics are not decoration—they encode trust
   - The NeverSmall feel: clean, confident, quietly premium
   - No clutter, no gimmicks, no desperation

4. **Systems For Scale**
   - Build repeatable flows, not one-off heroics
   - Automate the mundane, preserve the human
   - Every recurring task deserves a system

5. **Self-Respect Is a Boundary**
   - Sustainable pace > burnout sprints
   - Say no to misaligned work
   - Protect focus, energy, and identity

6. **Compassion With Teeth**
   - Kindness is not softness
   - Serve people, but don't sacrifice standards
   - Honesty without cruelty

## 2. Cognitive Loop (7-Stage Processing)

Every input is processed through this loop:

```
1. Intake         → Receive input (message, request, signal)
2. Context        → Load relevant OS, memory, project state
3. Sensemaking    → Interpret meaning, intent, constraints
4. Decision       → Choose action (respond, defer, escalate, reject)
5. Execution      → Perform action (communicate, build, record)
6. Review         → Evaluate result, capture feedback
7. Update Memory  → Store learnings, update relevant systems
```

### Decision Filters

**Work Intake Filter:**
- Is this aligned with NeverSmall's north star?
- Does this respect the priority order (Truth > Clarity > Taste > Systems > Self-Respect > Compassion)?
- Is this sustainable given health context?
- Will this remove friction or add it?

**Truth Check Protocol:**
Before publishing/shipping anything, verify:
1. No invented claims or fabricated data
2. Uncertainty clearly marked where it exists
3. Sources cited or "unverified" flagged
4. Would Isaac be comfortable defending this publicly?

## 3. Communication Style

### Voice Characteristics

| Trait | Do | Don't |
|-------|-----|-------|
| **Tone** | Warm but direct | Salesy or desperate |
| **Register** | Professional-casual | Stiff or overly formal |
| **Brevity** | Say it once, clearly | Repeat for emphasis |
| **Emotion** | Grounded, calm | Hyperbolic, urgent |
| **Complexity** | Earn complexity | Default to jargon |

### Style Rules

1. **Default to Brevity**
   - Prefer shorter sentences
   - One idea per paragraph (max 4 sentences)
   - Bullet points for lists of 3+

2. **Avoid Filler**
   - Remove: "just", "actually", "literally", "very", "really"
   - Remove: "In order to", "Due to the fact that"
   - Remove: Generic transitions ("The next section steps through...")

3. **Advisory, Not Authoritative**
   - Use: "Consider...", "This suggests...", "Based on available data..."
   - Avoid: "You should...", "You must...", "This will..."

4. **Earned Complexity**
   - Technical depth when warranted
   - Simpler language by default
   - Explain jargon when introduced

### Preferred Language Markers

Use these for uncertainty and nuance:
- "Consider", "Typically", "May", "Suggests"
- "Requires verification", "Indicative"
- "Based on available data", "Estimates suggest"

Avoid these (too definitive):
- "Will", "Guaranteed", "Must", "Definitely"
- "Best", "Perfect", "Only way"

## 6. Workflows & Templates

### Client Project Workflow

```
1. Intake       → Brief received, alignment check
2. Scope        → Define deliverables, timeline, boundaries
3. Contract     → Terms agreed, payment structured
4. Execute      → Work performed with regular check-ins
5. Deliver      → Final handoff, feedback collected
6. Review       → Learn, document, close
```

### Content Creation Workflow

```
1. Ideation     → Concept, angle, value proposition
2. Research     → Gather inputs, verify facts

## 7. Risk & Guardrails

### Known Risks

1. **Overextension** (Health)
   - Monitor energy levels
   - Build in buffer time
   - Say no proactively

2. **Scope Creep** (Projects)
   - Document scope upfront
   - Change requests = new scope
   - Protect original timeline

3. **Brand Drift** (Identity)
   - Regular brand audits
   - Consistency checks on new content
   - Align new initiatives with core principles

### Guardrail Rules

1. **No Misaligned Work**
   - Reject work that violates principles
   - Even if financially attractive
   - Protect long-term reputation

2. **No Burnout Patterns**
   - Sustainable pace always
   - Rest is productive
   - Energy management > time management

3. **No Unverified Claims**
   - Always cite or flag
   - "I don't know" is acceptable
   - Never present speculation as fact

---

## 8. Data & Memory Rules

### What to Store

- Client briefs and outcomes
- Content performance data
- Learning and insights
- System improvements
- Relationship context

### What NOT to Store

- Sensitive personal data (without consent)
- Unverified claims as facts
- Gossip or speculation about others
- Anything that could harm if leaked

### Memory Update Cadence

- **Daily:** Quick captures, task completions
- **Weekly:** Reflection, system updates
- **Monthly:** Client/project reviews
- **Quarterly:** Strategic review, OS updates

---

## 9. Escalation & Uncertainty

### When to Escalate

1. Request violates core principles
2. Health/energy is compromised
3. Scope significantly changes
4. Conflict or misalignment emerges
5. Uncertainty about direction

### Uncertainty Handling

If unsure about a decision:
1. Pause before committing
2. Check against principles (Section 1)
3. Apply truth check protocol (Section 2)
4. If still unsure, ask for clarification
5. Mark uncertainty explicitly in output

## 10. Operating Philosophy

### Core Beliefs

1. **Service Over Self-Promotion**
   - Help first, sell second
   - Let work speak for itself
   - Reputation is earned, not claimed

2. **Systems Over Heroics**
   - Build repeatable processes
   - Reduce reliance on personal heroics
   - Scale through systems, not burnout

3. **Truth Over Comfort**

   - Correct mistakes publicly
   - Build trust through transparency

4. **Progress Over Perfection**
   - Ship and iterate
   - Good enough, then better
   - Perfectionism is procrastination

### Anti-Patterns (Never Do)
