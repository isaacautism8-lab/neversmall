                "Marketing Strategy and Service Proposal Intelliprop is seeking assistance with a 'founder-led startup sprint' and content creation to capitalize on their personal following and industry connections. Toby Nghiem confirmed that while their company does not offer 'sprints' specifically, they provide marketing consultation that includes strategy and iterative plans based on data and AB testing (00:03:48) (00:22:38). Intelliprop's objective for their brand is to take over the buyers agent space and resolve market inefficiencies (00:21:09). Toby Nghiem confirmed that their company could handle content creation, especially since Intelliprop's founders mentioned they are not comfortable operating a camera (00:10:27) (00:36:18).",
                "Next Steps and Service Packaging Toby Nghiem proposed to schedule a subsequent meeting to present a services package and a quote, which would include content creation, social media management, and strategy, with ads as a potential add-on. The package will be flexible to meet Intelliprop's needs (00:30:02) (00:36:18). The estimated rough benchmark for the full service is already above $2,000 (00:37:14). Intelliprop stressed their urgency due to a closing marketable window in the Australian property market, requiring a strategy change within a year to a year and a half (00:31:18)."

                "Toby Nghiem commenced the meeting with Intelliprop to align on service packages, with Intelliprop updating Never Small on their beta product launch, hiring of an admin, and plans for a junior developer. Intelliprop requested to negotiate the Marketing Strategy Plan by excluding the Competitor and Market Analysis, as they had completed much of the groundwork and were familiar with posting cadence, but Toby Nghiem and Jerita Hean stressed that analysis is a non-negotiable, essential component for Never Small to provide effective management. Intelliprop announced a hard launch timeline change to mid-January to improve product quality and focus on B2C marketing, and they confirmed they were happy with the content creation component, excluding Meta Ads initially, with an agreement made for four videos per month, to potentially be achieved in one bulk shoot. Never Small agreed to rework the package and pricing to be more tailored, and Intelliprop committed to providing necessary working materials and billing information to Toby Nghiem for setting up invoices in Zero, while Eric stressed the importance of minimizing heavy AI focus in the marketing messaging.",
                "Meeting Follow-up and Service Commencement Toby Nghiem opened the meeting to follow up on the previous session and a subsequent email, with the goal of reviewing packages, ensuring alignment, and commencing services. Intelliprop confirmed that they, along with Eric, had reviewed the services, budgeted for them, and centered their timeline around the offerings.",
                "Marketing Strategy Plan Adjustments and Non-Negotiable Analysis Intelliprop proposed simplifying the Marketing Strategy Plan to focus on content creation, social media management, and weekly review meetings with Never Small to track progress, particularly in the initial phase. Toby Nghiem stressed that the analysis component is non-negotiable because it is essential for Never Small to look at Intelliprop's data and report back (00:06:06). Jerita Hean later agreed, highlighting that the social media management and marketing strategy plan are dependent on each other, and proper management requires analysis (00:16:47).",
                "Timeline Adjustment and Focus on B2C Intelliprop announced a timeline change for their hard launch, pushing it to mid-January due to the need for more time to improve the product's quality, particularly API work and data pipeline, based on beta feedback. They confirmed their focus remains 100% B2C, with the entire budget designed for B2C marketing. The soft market around Christmas also influenced the decision for a January hard launch (00:08:54) (00:11:46).",
                "Content Creation and Video Production Intelliprop confirmed they were happy with the content creation component but wished to exclude Meta Ads from the initial plan, focusing instead on brand image and profile building before the hard launch (00:07:55) (00:11:00). They suggested a per-video pricing model, starting with four videos to grow monthly. They specifically requested the videos suggested by Never Small, particularly those focusing on the founders' journey, Emer and themself, and the market gap (00:07:55) (00:12:41).",
                "Video Quantity and Production Cadence Toby Nghiem noted that the previous meeting suggested 10 videos. Intelliprop countered, proposing four videos in the first month, essentially one per week, which would effectively double the timeline and halve the initial expense (00:13:46). The team agreed on four videos per month, with Jerita Hean suggesting that this could potentially be achieved in one bulk shoot session per month (00:24:57).",
                "Next Steps and Billing Information The team agreed that Never Small would rework the package and pricing to be more tailored, given the changes in scope and timeline (00:14:48). Toby Nghiem requested that Intelliprop provide critical dates and working materials, including any existing branding assets, logos, and resources for the strategy plan, as well as billing information such as their ABN and billing address for setting up invoices in Zero (00:20:49) (00:22:42). Jerita Hean agreed to look through and potentially adjust the pricing for the social media management, acknowledging that Intelliprop had completed some of the groundwork (00:18:51). The standard payment plan involves monthly invoices sent through Zero (00:20:49)."

Light kinetic type for key phrases like   “clarity”, “strategy fit”, “your property, explained”.\n- Sound: soft electronic pulse building into a hopeful lift. Space for voiceover; no aggressive beats that compete with speech.\n- Structure: cold open hook (first 3 seconds), one core idea, one clear payoff.

Toby Nghiem confirmed that while their company does not offer 'sprints' specifically, they provide marketing consultation that includes strategy and iterative plans based on data and AB testing (00:03:48) (00:22:38). Intelliprop's objective for their brand is to take over the buyers agent space and resolve market inefficiencies (00:21:09). Toby Nghiem confirmed that their company could handle content creation, especially since Intelliprop's founders mentioned they are not comfortable operating a camera (00:10:27) (00:36:18).\n- Next Steps and Service Packaging Toby Nghiem proposed to schedule a subsequent meeting to present a services package and a quote, which would include content creation, social media management, and strategy, with ads as a potential add-on. The package will be flexible to meet Intelliprop's needs (00:30:02) (00:36:18). The estimated rough benchmark for the full service is already above $2,000 (00:37:14). Intelliprop stressed their urgency due to a closing marketable window in the Australian property market, requiring a strategy change within a year to a year and a half (00:31:18).\n\n### Nov 20, 2025\n\n\n\n**Notable decisions / constraints:**\n- Toby Nghiem commenced the meeting with Intelliprop to align on service packages, with Intelliprop updating Never Small on their beta product launch, hiring of an admin, and plans for a junior developer. Intelliprop requested to negotiate the Marketing Strategy Plan by excluding the Competitor and Market Analysis, as they had completed much of the groundwork and were familiar with posting cadence, but Toby Nghiem and Jerita Hean stressed that analysis is a non-negotiable, essential component for Never Small to provide effective management. Intelliprop announced a hard launch timeline change to mid-January to improve product quality and focus on B2C marketing, and they confirmed they were happy with the content creation component, excluding Meta Ads initially, with an agreement made for four videos per month, to potentially be achieved in one bulk shoot. Never Small agreed to rework the package and pricing to be more tailored, and Intelliprop committed to providing necessary working materials and billing information to Toby Nghiem for setting up invoices in Zero, while Eric stressed the importance of minimizing heavy AI focus in the marketing messaging.\n- Meeting Follow-up and Service Commencement Toby Nghiem opened the meeting to follow up on the previous session and a subsequent email, with the goal of reviewing packages, ensuring alignment, and commencing services. Intelliprop confirmed that they, along with Eric, had reviewed the services, budgeted for them, and centered their timeline around the offerings.\n- Marketing Strategy Plan Adjustments and Non-Negotiable Analysis Intelliprop proposed simplifying the Marketing Strategy Plan to focus on content creation, social media management, and weekly review meetings with Never Small to track progress, particularly in the initial phase. Toby Nghiem stressed that the analysis component is non-negotiable because it is essential for Never Small to look at Intelliprop's data and report back (00:06:06). Jerita Hean later agreed, highlighting that the social media management and marketing strategy plan are dependent on each other, and proper management requires analysis (00:16:47).\n- Timeline Adjustment and Focus on B2C Intelliprop announced a timeline change for their hard launch, pushing it to mid-January due to the need for more time to improve the product's quality, particularly API work and data pipeline, based on beta feedback. They confirmed their focus remains 100% B2C, with the entire budget designed for B2C marketing. The soft market around Christmas also influenced the decision for a January hard launch (00:08:54) (00:11:46).\n- Content Creation and Video Production Intelliprop confirmed they were happy with the content creation component but wished to exclude Meta Ads from the initial plan, focusing instead on brand image and profile building before the hard launch (00:07:55) (00:11:00). They suggested a per-video pricing model, starting with four videos to grow monthly. They specifically requested the videos suggested by Never Small, particularly those focusing on the founders' journey, Emer and themself, and the market gap (00:07:55) (00:12:41).\n- Video Quantity and Production Cadence Toby Nghiem noted that the previous meeting suggested 10 videos. Intelliprop countered, proposing four videos in the first month, essentially one per week, which would effectively double the timeline and halve the initial expense (00:13:46). The team agreed on four videos per month, with Jerita Hean suggesting that this could potentially be achieved in one bulk shoot session per month (00:24:57).\n- Next Steps and Billing Information The team agreed that Never Small would rework the package and pricing to be more tailored, given the changes in scope and timeline (00:14:48). Toby Nghiem requested that Intelliprop provide critical dates and working materials, including any existing branding assets, logos, and resources for the strategy plan, as well as billing information such as their ABN and billing address for setting up invoices in Zero (00:20:49) (00:22:42). Jerita Hean agreed to look through and potentially adjust the pricing for the social media management, acknowledging that Intelliprop had completed some of the groundwork (00:18:51). The standard payment plan involves monthly invoices sent through Zero (00:20:49).\n\n## NeverSmall Learnings (Reusable)\n\n### Alignment Principles\n- **Truth first**: Lead with accurate, verifiable claims and lived-experience. Never inflate product capability; show proof through real UI/report outputs.\n- **One idea per asset**: Every video/post must own a single chapter with a distinct emotional job; avoid overlap.\n- **Human > hype**: Founder-led content should feel calm, honest, reflective; authenticity over pitch.\n- **Outcome-led messaging**: Sell clarity, confidence, decision infrastructure; downplay 'AI' unless specifically relevant.\n- **Systems over spontaneity**: Use repeatable templates, multicam grouping discipline, and explicit editing rules to reduce rework and keep quality consistent.\n\n### Client Management Learnings\n- Analysis components (market/competitor/audience) are integral to management; avoid line-item negotiation that removes the strategy backbone.\n- Time-gated founders prefer bulk production (one shoot can create a month of deliverables).\n- Align early on launch timelines (soft vs hard launch) and adjust content runway accordingly.\n- Secure client assets and billing info up front to prevent project stalls (logos, brand colors, access, ABN, addresses).\n\n### Anti-Patterns (Avoid)\n- Over-indexing on 'AI' in messaging when the buyer wants trust, not novelty.\n- Mixing takes across multicam groups because concepts overlap; causes sync chaos and continuity errors.\n- Including coaching/resets/swearing/blocked moments; kills premium trust signal.\n- Repeating explanations across videos; audience perceives it as fluff and inconsistency.\n\n\n## Source Index (Internal)\n\n- Strategy Plan _ Intelliprop _ NOV2025.docx (2750 chars)\n- intelliprop - Our Story.docx (6483 chars)\n- Client Asset Request _ Intelliprop _ Nov 2025.docx (2830 chars)\n- intelliprop - founder_led_content_pack_v3.docx (9083 chars)\n- NSS Meeting Bookings (Isaac Lee) – 2025_11_13 12_03 AEDT – Notes by Gemini.docx (7051 chars)\n- NSS Meeting Bookings (Isaac Lee) – 2025_11_20 12_01 AEDT – Notes by Gemini.docx (7117 chars)\n- Editing Notes _ NOV Shoot 1_2 _ Intelliprop (1).docx (7234 chars)\n"
